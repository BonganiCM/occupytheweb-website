          <h3>Tracking Flights</h3>
          <p>Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€”Broadcast (ADS-B)

ADS-B is the technology that enables us and other open source investigators to track flights. Aircraft are increasingly built or outfitted with ADS-B transponders. This data is unencrypted and easily picked up by ground antennas. This technology is rapidly replacing the old ground based radar system. The FAA required all aircraft in most U.S. controlled airspace to be equipped with ADS-B transponders January 1, 2020. As a result, nearly every aircraft has an ADS-B transponder.

Call Sign

The call sign is the unique identifier the aircraft uses during its flight. Commercial aircraft tend to use a call sign that is dependent on their route. Private planes tend to use their registration number. On commercial flights, the call sign may change for every flight

Registration

Aircraft are registered very similar to automobiles. Every aircraft has a registration number. This registration number is displayed on their tail section. These registration numbers are unique to each country. Aircraft owned and registered in one country will change their registration number when purchased and registered in another country.

Serial Number

Each aircraft is assigned a serial number by the manufacturer. This is similar to the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) on vehicles. This serial number, like VIN's on automobiles, is immutable. This makes it useful for tracking an aircraft over time between owners, registrations and nations.


Let's get started tracking aircraft and flights from around the world!
